# ia-pacmania
Aim is to test vibe coding by recreating a clone of Pacmania in 3D for fun

Goal of this demo was to test how far I could go wih Gemini 3 Pro + Anitgravity before the source code goes ... too hard to maintain and read! ;-)

From a technical perspective, this a selfcontained single HTML file with 2D graphics (generated wiht Banana Pro), musics gathered from https://chiptune.app/?q=pacmania, samples come from https://sounds.spriters-resource.com/arcade/pacmania/asset/439130/

The game includes
* 16 levels (including default MS.Pacman ones)
* 2 visions modes
* 6 ghosts (instead of 4)
* Free bugs ;-)

Traditionals Pacman tactics will work albeit I added a few addons to the original game hence you will have to adapt a bit!

Evolution is still possible as there are missing things from the original game:
* No bonus items
* Missing animations before a level start
* Scores locally saved in your browser database.


Hope you will enjoy this small game as much as I had pleasure to recreate it!

Kind regards,
