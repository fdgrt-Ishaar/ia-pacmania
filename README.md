# 🎮 About the Project

Hello! This game is a demonstration of Vibe Coding. It is a 3D reimagining of the classic arcade game Pac-Mania, rendered with a LEGO-style aesthetic using Three.js.

The game includes
* 16 levels (including default MS.Pacman ones)
* 2 visions modes
* 6 ghosts (instead of 4)
* Free bugs ;-)

While inspired by Pac-Mania, the tactics, physics, and logic differ slightly from the original arcade version. I hope you will have as much fun playing through the 16 levels of this game as I had building it!

Evolution is still possible as there are missing things from the original game:
* No bonus items
* Missing animations before a level start
* Scores locally saved in your browser database.

Feel free to fork, enhance, or fix what is needed. This game is far from perfect, but the main goal was to experience the flow of AI-assisted development.

# 🤖 The "Vibe Coding" Process


This project was built entirely through natural language interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). No manual coding was done in the traditional sense; everything was generated through prompts and "vibes."

# My AI Co-pilots:

Gemini 3 Pro (Google)

Claude (Anthropic)

Antigravity

# 🛠️ Technical Highlights

Single File Architecture: The entire game (logic, graphics, audio, UI) is contained within a single HTML file.

Asset Encoding: All assets, including music samples and textures, are encoded in Base64 strings directly within the code.

3D Engine: Built with Three.js with custom shaders for the "plastic" LEGO look and tilt-shift post-processing.

Audio Emulation: The music tracks are derived from the Sharp X68000 version of Pac-Mania and are played through a simulated Yamaha FM synthesis emulation style using the Web Audio API.
* Musics gathered from https://chiptune.app/?q=pacmania
* Samples come from https://sounds.spriters-resource.com/arcade/pacmania/asset/439130/
